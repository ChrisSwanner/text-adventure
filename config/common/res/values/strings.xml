&lt;p>The INTERNET and ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE permissions are required to allow game play analytics to be gathered.
This information is minimal and includes things like how many times you\'ve completed the game, how long it took and
how long the game takes to load. All of this data is anonymous and averaged out by the Google Analytics servers. There
is no personal data included in this information. This data will be used to understand what features of the game are used most
and where improvements can be made, for instance to speed up load times if there is seen to be an issue on certain devices.&lt;/p>
