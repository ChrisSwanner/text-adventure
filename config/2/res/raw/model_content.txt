Watching you in some amazement are a number of towns folk, gathering about you as one over friendly lady dusts you down before catching a glimpse of your face and starting back with a gasp. She turns and mutters to her neighbours and the mood of the mob quickly turns sour.

There is some hustle and then some bustle and the crowd slowly parts, a scrappy girl with a face like thunder careens out of the mob wielding a shoe above her head - Whack! - she clobbered you about the head with it!

You wake up some hours later, it must be late afternoon by the waning warmth of the sun, with a throbbing head ache and a mouth as dry as a sesame cracker. Sitting propped up against a wall, your hands tied behind your back, you wriggle your wrists looking for any give in the rope to no avail. Looking about you see Oubliette standing close by, watching you with a smaller girl waiting excitedly next to her.

After fighting your way past that beast only to be knocked out cold by a girl and now with a cracking headache, you wish someone would enlighten you as to what is going on.
item talk response to:sorehead:The girl sighs again. "You're the one aren't you. The one that fought the witch?". A rhetorical question, you nod anyway in case there is any doubt. Quick as a flash you catch the blur of swift moving leather footwear heading for your face and duck to avoid it. Unfortunately for you the boot was heading towards your chest so you take the blow right on the top of the head, fortunately it's not as strong a blow as you recall the last being. Looking up you see Oubliette restraining the younger girl who is positively gleaming with joy. You deduce it was she who cruelly swung at you.

item talk response to:ididntabandonyou:"In any case, the witch lives - she attacks our town every night sending foul beasts of darkness to ravage our homes, our families and friends.". Oubliette starts to cry as she talks and turns away from you - "She killed my mother, those beasts breached the barricade one night and dragged her away into the forest.". Regaining her resolve Oubliette wipes her eyes and turns to face you. "You must help us, you defeated her before, you need to finish what you started.".

item talk response to:okillhelpyou:Oubliette and Flechette both look delighted, the older girl runs forward and flings her arms around you. "Thank you, I know you can help us. My father has been running the town since the mayor died, his name is Cabal Jambon, and we are desperate for help.". Swiftly she unties your hands and helps you to stand.

"Take my boat to cross the river, you'll find our neighbouring town of Ubiquity a short way from the other bank.

The main purpose of this of course is not to actually sell muck, but to make other people feel better about their own lives. As such the most common buyer of muck is the up and coming trader, the aspirer to greater things. This means that whilst the act of muck selling is not the most glamorous of jobs, it does have the advantage of providing a reliable and reasonable income. This particular lady appears some what crone-like, stooping and revelling just a little in her down and out professional persona. Her hair is matted and a dirty grey, her clothes mostly rags and she grimaces and gurns at passers combined with a well practised nasal whine as she does so.

It's teeth are sharp and pointy and you recognise it as a spiky-toothed goober. You grab the fish, detach the lure and hold it flapping about in your arms.

The turpet is a big, fat worm, also known as Crane's turpet after the famous biologist, who met his maker shortly after discovering and naming the turpet and then while testing it's indivisibility, he succumbed to blood loss from an accidentally toe amputation. Later biologists determined that this unexpectedly rapid exsanguination could be attributed to the same chemical which allowed the turpet to reconstitute itself after being chopped up. Upon the first chopping it released a sufficient amount into the air to trigger temporary haemophilia and the combination of the chemical and Crane's unwavering experimental determination sealed his fate.

item name:Plethora of Harmonizing Gibbets
item description:Much like a cricket might produce a loud chirping the harmonizing gibbets create an intense blanket of noise through rubbing parts of their bodies together. However a single gibbet cannot make any sound at all as the body parts required to produce the sound are at opposing and unreachable ends of the fist-sized insect's body. When one or more gibbets come together they will often conjoin so that the dorsal fin can rub against the ventral fin to produce a piercing but specific note. Each pair of gibbets will produce a different note depending on the size of their fins so that a sort of choir effect will fill the air, hence their common name of harmonizing gibbets.

It seems quiet but there is some activity, a low murmur of scurrying, people avoiding the outside by running between buildings, dodging between shadows. A strange place. The main road is before you, stretching on with only a few tributaries, homes and businesses intermingled as the road flows past. The road continues out of the town to the east and on past a farm and further on towards a river in the distance.

It won't get you far underwater, but maybe just far enough.

location description:In the centre of the room a hanging cage draws your attention, the primary feature it looks like it has been put to much use. Scattered scraps of food litter the floor beneath it and you see the odd glint of white-grey bone fragments on the floor - the remains of dinner or just remains?
text to show on first entry:You walk into the room and pause for a moment to take in your surroundings. Your attention is immediately drawn to the girl in a cage suspended from the ceiling in the centre of the room, it looks like Oubliette. You hear a chuckle from the shadows - "So it was you who broke my barrier." The voice sounds familiar but is very croaky. Before you realise it the witch is upon you, Bella Constantine! You recognise her face as she rushes at you from one of the platforms at the edge of the room, a great leaping glide through the air and she levitates across the space to land only a few feet away from you.<newline>The witch mocks you. "Welcome hero. You have come for your revenge, your reckoning for this world upon me? I think you are weak. You cannot stop me. You are no hero, just weak flesh and bone, flawed and scared. This isn't honourable, this isn't justice despite what you may think, you are no better than I. I'll warrant there are moments, in your grave and fearsome determination when you would collapse this hate filled, miserable world in on itself if given the power. Scream at the empty, pitiless sky - it will not listen to you.". She screams herself to emphasise the point and leaps away again into the shadows.

Putting her down gently she puts her arms around your neck and gives you a passionate kiss. "You saved me." she says and holds onto you as though she will never let go. You grasp her in return, relief rushing from you as you realise your quest is over. The witch is vanquished forever and Oubliette is safe, you have kept your promise to her father and sister and to the townsfolk of Ubiquity and Perpetuity. Oubliette kisses your cheek and leaves to return to her waiting father and sister, allowing you a moment to contemplate everything you have done.

A shape forms behind the cloth, getting larger until it stands taller than you - then the robe slips off to reveal a creature of nightmares. A horned demon pierces your mind with it's hateful gaze, focusing all of it's will upon you. Under this psychic weight you fall down to your knees and hear the demon snarl, lifting one clawed foot and stepping slowly towards you.
