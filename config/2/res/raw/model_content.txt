location description:You are standing outside a small town. The main street goes north, to the west there are some small out buildings and to the east you can see what looks like an old mine shaft. The name of the town is etched on the sign above in once proud lettering - "Perpetuity".
text to show on first entry:Staring up at the town sign swinging across the gate above you realise it has been many years since you were last here. The town itself looks quiet but not how you left it. It looks almost defeated. Your heart starts to beat noticeably faster, pounding away in your chest as you think back, as you remember your encounter with the witch Bella Constantine.

location description:You are on the main street of the town. There is a clock tower further to the north but a large barricade of furniture, barrels and hay carts blocks your way. The only way to continue is through Merchants Lane and perhaps you can circle around the barricade. Besides the jumbled barrier there is further evidence of a large disturbance all around - the walls of the nearby buildings appear to have deep gouged claw marks and a number of the barrels have been rendered to splinters.

location description:Merchants Lane stretches out ahead of you, abandoned and battered, not a single shop is open or has the slightest sign of life. These shops have been closed for some time now and this street hasn't seen a merry day in many a month. There is one shop door which has the corner broken in, as though something has forced it's way inside.

He has the air of importance and wealth and you deduce that this must be Oren Constantine the famous merchant.
