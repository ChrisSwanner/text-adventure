Watching you in some amazement are a number of towns folk, gathering about you as one over friendly lady dusts you down before catching a glimpse of your face and starting back with a gasp. She turns and mutters to her neighbours and the mood of the mob quickly turns sour.

There is some hustle and then some bustle and the crowd slowly parts, a scrappy girl with a face like thunder careens out of the mob wielding a shoe above her head - Whack! - she clobbered you about the head with it!

You must never beat a stranger with a shoe, you might as well tickle them, always use a good sturdy leather boot.". With that he passes her the sturdiest, leatheriest boot you've ever seen.

You wake up some hours later, it must be late afternoon by the waning warmth of the sun, with a throbbing head ache and a mouth as dry as a sesame cracker. Sitting propped up against a wall, your hands tied behind your back, you wriggle your wrists looking for any give in the rope to no avail. Looking about you see Oubliette standing close by, watching you with a smaller girl waiting excitedly next to her.

"Take my boat to cross the river, you'll find our neighbouring town of Ubiquity a short way from the other bank.

You pull and wind, pull and wind and out of the river it comes. Firmly attached to the lure there is a large fish, about the length of your forearm and twice as wide, almost grinning as it chomps on the lure. It's teeth are sharp and pointy and you recognise it as a spiky-toothed goober. You grab the fish, detach the lure and hold it flapping about in your arms. You discard the rod as it is cumbersome and impractical to carry around any further.

He's obviously been through this before, but not for a good long time judging by the length of his coat. Confidently you slap the yak on his bottom, in response to which he kicks back landing a hoof all too close to your delicates. You wince and have to hurry to get around the yak and zap him onwards through the town entrance before he makes his getaway.

Most of the houses and buildings lining the street are closed or boarded up, secured from the inside as though the town has been through some tough times. The walls and doors look battered and damaged and you suspect that the people of this town endured a similar onslaught to that which you witnessed in Perpetuity. Back to the east the road winds out of the town. There are a couple of open shops which might be worth a closer look and some further west in the area known as The Rickets that most certainly aren't.

item description:It is slightly larger than a metric cow but smaller than an average horse. It's hairy, bad tempered and prone to biting so you stay well back. This particular yak has a very shaggy coat, you reckon it would make at least four good sized winter jackets or a single yacket. The yak notices you looking at it and snorts loudly in your direction, partly spraying you with nasal fluid. It sprays with a lot more fluid than an accidental spraying might generate, you half suspect it did it on purpose.

The barrow itself has been formed with several massive boulders and two giant slabs of rock creating a roof to the enclosure. The wind softly whistles through gaps in the stone blowing an occasional whiff of stale air in your direction. A gentle tapping sound seems to emanate from somewhere below your feet, which you find unnerving to say the least. There is a small path which climbs slightly higher up through the rocks behind the barrow.

The plateau on which you find yourself is desolate save for a few dead trees marking the edge of a path leading to a rotten yet imposing stone gate. The iron work which would have formed the gate itself is missing but leaves the surrounding stone supports as an appropriate frame for what lies further on - a black, dead castle. This must be the castle that Larry the Yak Shaver told you about, this must be the Witch Bella's stronghold. Shadows seem to dance playfully over the cold stone turrets and vanish into windows and doorways to reappear from another nearby but you cannot tell if it is simply the reflected movement of the seemingly permanent clouds overhead, looming angrily and with menace.<newline>Stepping closer to the gate you feel the air tighten about you, almost pushing you back. You persist but the more you push forward the harder you are repelled, the feeling is both bizarre and uncomfortable, as though being grasped by mighty fluid hands. There is no way forward here. You sense that powerful forces are at work and you will have to fight them with something of equal measure.

Eventually you start to reply "What are..." but before you can say any more he interrupts you - "How much do you need this time?

You imagine the rest of the site must be a dangerous place, if only for the instability of the structure surrounding you. The castle gate lies on the south side of the quadrangle, where the gatehouse envelopes a sad portcullis, guarding nothing but the decaying remains of this abandoned castle.
text to show on first entry:You clamber over the rocks and leap down into the courtyard below. Standing quietly you listen carefully for the sound of any scurrying animals or tweeting birds. Strangely you hear nothing which adds to your unsettled feeling that something else is here with you.

Leaving the winch handle in place you push a few bricks underneath for extra support in case the winch fails to hold.

A deep growling, a whoosh of air and the barrelling goon shoots out of the tower down the ramp towards your feet at a breakneck pace hurtling into the hollow section of tree trunk and out onto the connected ramp. A short squeal of surprise and the creature is launched over the castle walls, a bundle of fur flying through the air, leaving the courtyard unguarded and free for foragers to reap the mushroomy rewards within.

She turns away to leave but hesitates - "I also found this amongst the rocks" nodding towards one of the barrelling goon's slides as she passes you a charred bone. You take it cautiously, noting the spiralling runes carved into the surface. "It's weird, goons don't usually come this close to town, maybe this has something to do with it." she shrugs. "Anyway I'm heading back to town, you know the way - thanks again!" and off she goes without glancing back. You stand alone in the courtyard shuffling your shoes and decide to head back to town with her.
