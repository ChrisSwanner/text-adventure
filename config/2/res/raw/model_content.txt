The town itself looks quiet but not how you left it. It looks almost defeated. Your heart starts to beat noticeably faster, pounding away in your chest as you think back, as you remember your encounter with the witch Bella Constantine.

Unfortunately for you the boot was heading towards your chest so you take the blow right on the top of the head, fortunately it's not as strong a blow as you recall the last being.

A deep growling, a whoosh of air and the barrelling goon shoots out of the tower down the ramp towards your feet at a breakneck pace hurtling into the hollow section of tree trunk and out onto the connected ramp. A short squeal of surprise and the creature is launched over the castle walls, a bundle of fur flying through the air, leaving the courtyard unguarded and free for foragers to reap the mushroomy rewards within.

item use action:change location description:castle_courtyard_2:This is the north end of the quadrangle surrounded on all sides by rotting buildings in various states of decay. There is a tower in one corner that has been more resistant to the relentless encroachment of vegetation and from it seems to be a slide that has been purposely built or fashioned by repeated use. It is made of worn bricks and leads from the top of the tower to close by your feet. You can see some fungi interspersed through the ruins.
