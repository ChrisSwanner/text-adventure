text to show on first entry:Staring up at the town sign swinging across the gate above you realise it has been many years since you were last here. The town itself looks quiet but not how you left it. It looks almost defeated. Your heart starts to beat noticeably faster, pounding away in your chest as you think back, as you remember your encounter with the witch Bella Constantine.

location description:You are in the study of the Constantine Mansion. There is a roaring fire on the west wall that crackles and lights the room up with flickers of flame. There is a large desk and two large chairs facing each other over it, both with high backs and wide arms.
text to show on first entry:Staring into the fire on the far wall memories flicker back to life as you recall the last time you were here, that terrible battle with the witch Bella Constantine, her screaming as she ran through the door cursing you with her last ounce of energy.
