location description:You are standing outside a small town. The main street goes north, to the west there are some small out buildings and to the east you can see what looks like an old mine shaft. The name of the town is etched on the sign above in once proud lettering - "Perpetuity".
text to show on first entry:Staring up at the town sign swinging across the gate above you realise it has been many years since you were last here. The town itself looks quiet but not how you left it. It looks almost defeated. Your heart starts to beat noticeably faster, pounding away in your chest as you think back, as you remember your encounter with the witch Bella Constantine.

location description:You are on the main street of the town. There is a clock tower further to the north but a large barricade of furniture, barrels and hay carts blocks your way. The only way to continue is through Merchants Lane and perhaps you can circle around the barricade. Besides the jumbled barrier there is further evidence of a large disturbance all around - the walls of the nearby buildings appear to have deep gouged claw marks and a number of the barrels have been rendered to splinters.

location description:Merchants Lane stretches out ahead of you, abandoned and battered, not a single shop is open or has the slightest sign of life. These shops have been closed for some time now and this street hasn't seen a merry day in many a month. The door to the general store has taken quite a beating. The corner is splintered and shattered, leaving a hole through which you might be able to fit your arm. A closer examination might reveal whether there is any point in doing this although it appears something has forced it's way inside so a little caution might be in order.
text to show on first entry:Stepping over the broken pieces of crockery and half-melted knives spread across the street you start to wonder if it was a good idea to return to this town.

item talk follow up phrase to:canyouhelpme:whatsyourprice:What's your price?:"What's your price? I've not got much.". Always best to sow the seeds of expectation before assumption screws up a good deal.
item talk response to:whatsyourprice:Another pause. "Well I'm in need of one thing you have, that tool in your pocket.". You wonder how it knew what's in your pocketses. Still, at least it wants something that you actually have. "Ok" you say, "have the multitool, just get me out of here quick.". A short but rough rummage around in your pockets the likes of which you've not endured for many a year yields the multitool to your helper. Quick as a flash there is some banging, a lot of jiggling, poking and general proddery and you are standing free, arm in tact, in front of the general store with the door now slightly ajar. You look around to see if you can spot whoever helped you knowing it is futile and that they have already gone.
