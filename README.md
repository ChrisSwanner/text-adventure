Text Adventure
==============

An Android old-skool text adventure game. This is another exercise in TDD in an Android environment.

Don't forget to drive the development by producing value - the value is game content and this should drive the development of functionality to support it.

Backlog
=======

- [STORY] Take clock face to top of clock tower and use with clock mechanism and minute hand and hour hand. Get some points or money or something and maybe a quest/hint as to what to do next - open up a new area.
  PARTIAL - [TEST] Show a ruby counter at the top of the screen. Also have a nice little ruby graphic.
  - [TEST] The ruby counter should show what the presenter gives the activity. The presenter should get the value from the model. The presenter needs to advertise at the same time as the description and exits, e.g. after actions are performed.
  - [TEST] Succesful use text "You fit the final piece of the clock. The air stirs around you as you slide it gently into place. blah blah you get some rubies"
  - [TEST] New ItemAction something like AwardRubies

- [FEATURE] About dialog available from main menu.
- [FEATURE] Autosave upon leaving the app (with the back key usually) so upon returning the user can continue their game.
- [FEATURE] Restart game - resets everything. Available in the main menu.

- [REFACTOR] LocationTests and TakeSpecificItemTests are using real NormalItems - change to use mocks
- [TEST] action view includes a cancel button to reset the actions to the top level
- [FEATURE] Actions buttons view should be fixed size and scrollable - 1/4 to 1/3 of the screen height
- [FEATURE] Ruby counter should show how many out of how many achieved - e.g. 10/100

- [FEATURE-EDITOR] Update webapp editor to [de]serialise visibility and allow setting of visibility
- [FEATURE-EDITOR] Update webapp editor to allow adding/deletion of on examine actions to items

- [REFACTOR] Item interface is getting fat. Can 'use' and 'examine' be split off, perhaps Examinable, Usable? Is there any benefit?

- [FEATURE] In model content txt items can only be used in one direction, e.g. a spade with a mound of earth and the target item has to include the definition of what happens. If the original item (e.g. spade) includes this information it is ignored. Should this be changed to be bi-directional? It would make writing content easier but needs considering as it might not always be appropriate.

- [REFACTOR]
  - [TEST] View/Presenter moveThroughExit interface should use 'Exit' actions instead of Exit objects directly and should use a common 'UserActionHandler::handleAction' interface

- Add monsters, npcs

- Add other verbs - attack, eat, drink, dance, take, drop, give, talk

- Optional images to go with text?
